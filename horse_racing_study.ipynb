    "#### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 50,257 rows of horse observations for 3272 horses. The reason this number is higher than the observations in the Races data frame is that the data is historic for the horse, and includes races before 2022 and at other racetracks. Usually a horse would start its career at smaller tracks and would only 'graduate' to the courses in scope after having proven itself elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only a handful of Group 1 races every year, so Group 1 wins are rare. The highest number of wins is 9. Almost all horses have zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horses have a mean of about 23 starts. This reflects that most horses have already had some expererience racing, with on average 4 wins, 3 seconds and 3 thirds, and about \\\\$356,000 in winnings. The winningest horse has over \\\\$20 million in career winnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average a race has about 10-11 runners, with a maximum of 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'prize' column is the total prize pool for that race. The median value is \\\\$55,000; the mean is quite a bit higher at \\\\$161,307.\n",
    "\n",
    "Races range from an 800m sprint to a whopping 4600m long-distance event. Most races are around 1400 metres. Track conditions range from 2 to 10, with most being a 4 to 6. Weight carried ranges from a svelte 49kg to a husky 76kg.\n",
    "\n",
    "800m/400m lengths behind data is a little lower than in the races table (5.5-5.6 here as opposed to 6.4 in the Races data frame). This is probably due to the fact that these horses tended to finish closer to the front in their early careers racing against lower-quality opposition. Similarly, the margin here is 3.96 as opposed to 4.79 in the Races data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds quoted are the odds offered by Set-Price (SP) bookmakers at the start of the race."
