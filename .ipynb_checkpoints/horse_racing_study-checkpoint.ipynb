    "The racecourse (Caulfield, Flemington, Rosehill Gardens or Royal Randwick).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### race_no\n",
    "The individual race number in the meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### datetime\n",
    "The date and time of the race.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### distance  \n",
    "The distance of the race. Sprints are usually around a kilometre or a bit longer, long-distance races are 2 kilometres or longer (the Melbourne cup is 3200 metres).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### class \n",
    "The class of the race. Group 1 races are the highest, down to Group 3 then Listed races.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### track_cond  \n",
    "The rating of the track. A rating of 1 means firm and fast, 10 means a heavy bog.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### track_rail\n",
    "The position of the rail on the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### race_time\n",

    "##### position \n",
    "The finishing position of the horse in the race.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### horse_name\n",
    "The name of the horse. Horse names should be unique therefore can be used as an identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### barrier\n",
    "The starting barrier for the race. Barrier 1 is closest to the rail. The closer the barrier, the shorter the distance to the finishing post, assuming that the race includes some bends. A wider barrier might carry an advantage if the track is heavy and has been churned up close to the rail.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### trainer\n",
    "The trainer of the horse. Usually the same trainer will train a horse for an extended length of time, though it's possible the owners will decide to change trainers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### jockey\n",
    "The jockey riding the horse in this race. It is more likely the horse will be ridden by different jockeys at different times.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### weight\n",
    "Thoroghbred horseracing in Australia is handicapped by weight; i.e., different horses will carry different weights to make the races closer and more interesting. If the jockey weighs less than the required weight they will carry extra weight in the saddle.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### prize\n",
    "The individual prize money won by this horse in this race.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 800m\n",
    "The position the horse in with 800 metres to go.\n",

    "The position the horse in with 400 metres to go.\n",

    "The distance in lengths the horse finished behind the winner. A value of 0 means the horse won.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### horse_adjusted_t1_speed\n",
    "This is a standardised 'speed' that we can use to attempt like-for-like comparisons of horses.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we convert the margin to a distance then calculate the speed using 1 length ~= 2.4 metres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, adjust the speed in two different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a formula to standardise the speeds of horses over, different distances, basically calling a 60 sec 1000 metre sprint and a 210 sec 3200 metre race the same speed and using a log curve in between as appropriate.\n",
    "                \n",
    "We also add a factor for the track condition.\n",
    "* Track rating 1-3 means no adjustment\n",
    "* For every point above 3, we increase the speed by 0.5%, so\n",
    "e.g. a track rating of 7 attracts a multiplier of 1.02 (2%).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### sp\n",
    "The bookmaker's payout for the horse winning the race. E.g., a figure of 10 means that a $1 wager paid out $10 ($9 profit).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### s_tab_win\n",
    "The TAB payout for the horse winning the race.\n",
    "\n",

    "The TAB payout for the horse finishing in the top 3 places."

    "#### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 50,257 rows of horse observations for 3272 horses. The reason this number is higher than the observations in the Races data frame is that the data is historic for the horse, and includes races before 2022 and at other racetracks. Usually a horse would start its career at smaller tracks and would only 'graduate' to the courses in scope after having proven itself elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only a handful of Group 1 races every year, so Group 1 wins are rare. The highest number of wins is 9. Almost all horses have zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horses have a mean of about 23 starts. This reflects that most horses have already had some expererience racing, with on average 4 wins, 3 seconds and 3 thirds, and about \\\\$356,000 in winnings. The winningest horse has over \\\\$20 million in career winnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average a race has about 10-11 runners, with a maximum of 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'prize' column is the total prize pool for that race. The median value is \\\\$55,000; the mean is quite a bit higher at \\\\$161,307.\n",
    "\n",
    "Races range from an 800m sprint to a whopping 4600m long-distance event. Most races are around 1400 metres. Track conditions range from 2 to 10, with most being a 4 to 6. Weight carried ranges from a svelte 49kg to a husky 76kg.\n",
    "\n",
    "800m/400m lengths behind data is a little lower than in the races table (5.5-5.6 here as opposed to 6.4 in the Races data frame). This is probably due to the fact that these horses tended to finish closer to the front in their early careers racing against lower-quality opposition. Similarly, the margin here is 3.96 as opposed to 4.79 in the Races data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds quoted are the odds offered by Set-Price (SP) bookmakers at the start of the race."
