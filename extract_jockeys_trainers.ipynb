    "There are a total of 11,881 data rows across 1301 races, 1 for each horse in each race.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a maximum of 10 races per meet. Race distances range from 1000 metres to 3200 metres. The track condition is never lower than 3 (Good) but can go as high as 10 (Very Heavy). Because these are high-profile tracks they tend to be well-maintained (good amounts of grass and moisture).\n",
    "\n",
    "The prize money for an entire race ranges from $50,000 to $15,000,000, with a mean of $330,969.50.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum number of finishers is 21 (note some races could have more runners that were scratched or failed to finish).\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum weight carried was 49kg, the maximum 65kg. The mean weight is about 56.5kg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual prize money can range from zero (smaller races only tend to pay the first few finishers) to $6.749 million for winning the Melbourne Cup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lengths behind the leader at the 800m/400m marks is capped at 21 lengths (totally out of contention).\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean margin behind the winner is about 4.79 lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SP (bookie) price is the price offered when the race started. I have zeroed the values when nothing was recorded. The mean win odds are $22.42. Therefore, in general, most horses are long-shots. The highest odds offered were $301.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TAB win and place odds are the actual payouts recorded, therefore they are usually zero. The highest odds paid out were $95.90 for a win and $25 for a place."

    "#### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 50,257 rows of horse observations for 3272 horses. The reason this number is higher than the observations in the Races data frame is that the data is historic for the horse, and includes races before 2022 and at other racetracks. Usually a horse would start its career at smaller tracks and would only 'graduate' to the courses in scope after having proven itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only a handful of Group 1 races every year, so Group 1 wins are rare. The highest number of wins is 9. Almost all horses have zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horses have a mean of about 23 starts. This reflects that most horses have already had some expererience racing, with on average 4 wins, 3 seconds and 3 thirds, and about $356,000 in winnings. The winningest horse has over $20 million in career winnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average a race has about 10-11 runners, with a maximum of 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'prize' column is the total prize pool for that race. The median value is $55,000; the mean is quite a bit higher at $161,307.\n",
    "\n",
    "Races range from an 800m sprint to a whopping 4600m long-distance event. Most races are around 1400 metres. Track conditions range from 2 to 10, with most being a 4 to 6. Weight carried ranges from a svelte 49kg to a husky 76.\n",
    "\n",
    "800m/400m lengths behind data is a little lower than in the races table (5.5-5.6 here as opposed to 6.4 in the Races data frame). This is probably due to the fact that these horses tended to finish closer to the front in their early careers racing against lower-quality opposition. Similarly, the margin here is 3.96 as opposed to 4.79 in the Races data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds quoted are the odds offered by Set-Price (SP) bookmakers at the start of the race.\n",
